Overview

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction Classification Task. In this task, we import passenger data from the infamous RMS Titanic and build a predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" The dataset includes various features such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and more, which you can use to train your model.

Dataset
The dataset we provide is in CSV format and consists of two files:

train.csv: This file contains the training data that you can use to build and train your predictive model. Each row corresponds to a passenger, and the columns represent various features and the target variable 'Survived' (1 for survived, 0 for not survived).

test.csv: This file contains the test data on which you will apply your trained model to predict survival outcomes. The structure is the same as the training data, but it does not contain the 'Survived' column.

Goal

Our goal in this challenge is to create a model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on the given features. It will be evaluated on the basis of the model's performance on an unseen test dataset.

Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this challenge is accuracy. Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions to the total number of passengers in the test dataset.

Submission Guidelines

To submit the solution, I have followed these steps:

Trained my predictive model using the training dataset train.csv.
Used my trained model to predict survival outcomes for the test dataset test.csv.
